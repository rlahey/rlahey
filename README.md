### HELLO WORLD üëã

My name is Rachael Lahey and I am new to the coding scene.  If you asked me 3 years ago what I would be doing today, I would have never imagined I would be creating a README on my own GitHub account. Coding was something I was always  fascinated by ever since I started my QA job at Wayfair.com but that fascination came with a little bit of nerves.  Seeing web developers create webpages with so many features with so much functionality always amazed me.  I knew coding was something I wanted to master so I took it upon myself to make that happen.
Coding is convenient and is not going anywhere so I left Wayfair at the end of 2022 and started at Launch Academy January 2023 right here in Boston. One of my passions in life has always revolved around sustainability and our planet in general so I went to school for Environmental Science.  I would love to be able to combine my newly learned coding skills with my passion for sustainability.

Aside from sustainability, another passion of mine that I think my friends and family can all agree on is my love for animals.  I grew up with pets and in my adult years, I‚Äôve always had a pet living with me. I am everyone's  go-to dog sitter as well!  My past co-workers have called my apartment the ‚Äúrevolving door of dogs‚Äù.
